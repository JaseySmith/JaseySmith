### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ my name is Jasey.
- I like to build beautiful custom websites for businesses that need them. As I learn more, I will get involved in building software and one day create my own.

- Iâ€™m currently learning about the MERN stack and deploying full-stack web applications.

- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any project that sparks my interest. That includes anything innovative having to do do with the web, tech, AI, machine learning, etc.

- You can reach me at jaseyhsmith@gmail.com.
